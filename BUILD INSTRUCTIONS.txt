Build Instructions

1. Create a Windows 98se or 2000 VM in VMWare or Virtualbox
	Real hardware will work too but this is easier
2. Install Visual C++ 6.0 (No service packs) with all options
3. Install Windows 2000 DDK with all options except Alpha code selected
4. Copy the source tree to any folder under C:\NTDDK\src\wdm\audio\
	I use C:\NTDDK\src\wdm\audio\hdac
5. Open a "Checked Build Environment" or "Free Build Environment" command prompt 
	(Start > Programs > Development Kits > Windows 2000 DDK)
	checked builds include debug prints and extra memory bounds checking.
6. CD to the C:\NTDDK\src\wdm\audio directory and run "build -cZ"
	this will build all the sample audio drivers because we need stdunk.cpp and the headers from them
	After the first build, you can build in the subdirectory.

HDA.SYS will be built in the "objfre" or "objchk" folders. Install it with hda.inf

Quick Guide to source files: Most of this code is from the Win2k DDK AC97 and SB16 sample drivers
Also used code from BleskOS, MPXPlay, MSDN references
