Build Instructions

1. Create a Windows 98se or 2000 VM
2. Install Visual C++ 6.0 (No service packs) with all options
3. Install Windows 2000 DDK with all options except Alpha code selected
4. Copy the source tree to C:\NTDDK\src\wdm\audio\hdac
5. Open a "Checked Build Environment" or "Free Build Environment" command prompt 
	(Start > Programs > Development Kits > Windows 2000 DDK)
	checked builds include debug prints and extra memory bounds checking.
6. CD to the C:\NTDDK\src\wdm\audio directory and run "build -cZ"
	this will build all the sample audio drivers as well but we need stdunk.cpp and the headers from them
	After the first build, you can build in the hdac directory.

HDA.SYS will be built in the "objfre" or "objchk" folders. Install it with hda.inf
