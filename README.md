# WDMHDA
HD Audio driver for Windows 98SE / ME

This project is a High Definition Audio aka Azalia codec and controller driver. It's for Intel 915 and later chipsets motherboard onboard audio that's not AC97. 
Designed for all versions of Windows with WDM support, aka Windows 98SE and ME (and possibly 98FE and 2000/XP as well, but not tested there yet.) 

Current status of this driver is a Proof of Concept that functions in VMware and VirtualBox, and on many Intel & VIA chipset HD Audio controllers with Realtek codecs; further development and testing is needed to support more real hardware.

This driver is dependent on the BIOS Pin Configuration defaults for selecting a sensible combination of outputs and there are no overrides yet for buggy BIOSes. You may experience garbled or glitchy audio, possible horrible screeching and popping noises or static, or complete silence, as well as possible hard freezes when the driver is loaded or unloaded. Nvidia and AMD chipsets are not well supported yet.

If you want to use this in some kind of business critical production application, I would highly recommend using a Sound Blaster Live, CMI8738 or any $2 USB Audio dongle instead. (Seriously, almost all of the cheapest USB dongles work perfectly in 98se/Me. If you're using QuickInstall 0.9.6 you will need to add the wdma_usb.inf file back to C:\Windows\Inf though)

Windows 9x may need to be patched to function at all on modern hardware and > 512mb of RAM even when virtualized. For Intel 12th gen and newer this is Mandatory. See [JHRobotics' Patcher9x project](https://github.com/JHRobotics/patcher9x) which now includes [Sweetlow's patch for memory resource conflict issues](https://msfn.org/board/topic/186768-bug-fix-vmmvxd-on-handling-4gib-addresses-and-description-of-problems-with-resource-manager-on-newer-bioses/). 

## Installation:

Install HDA.inf with Device Manager on the HD Audio Controller device which will be listed as a "PCI Card" with class code 0403 (you can run hwinfo /gui to see the vendor /device info on unknown devices). Select the location of the HDA.sys file when Windows asks you. The release build of the driver is in the buildfre\i386 folder, the debug build is in buildchk\i386.

For best results, go to the Multimedia control panel, Click the Advanced Properties button for the Playback device, go to the Performance tab and set Audio Acceleration to Standard (one notch to the left of Full) and Sample Rate Conversion Quality to Best (all the way to the right).

It is recommended but not strictly necessary to install DirectX 8.1 or newer after installing this driver. 

## Current Limitations:

- Only supports 22-48khz 16-bit sample rate (up to 96khz 32-bit could technically be added but 9x doesn't make the best choices about resampling)
- Playback only, recording is not supported
- Single audio stream, no hardware mixing
- Audio latency is ~40 ms at best. This is a kernel limit
- Volume control is only implemented for the main mix output
- Jack detection and retasking is not supported
- Only initializes the first codec detected on the link (extra codecs in laptop docking stations or HDMI audio won't work yet)
- Freezes, fails to start or outputs horrible noises on a lot of real hardware. No guarantees.

Testing and feedback from anyone who can run this on bare metal with a [kernel debugger](https://bikodbg.com/blog/2021/08/win98-ddk/) will be appreciated.
